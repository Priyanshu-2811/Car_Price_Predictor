# Car Price Predictor

## Overview
This project aims to predict the price of a used car using machine learning techniques. It takes into account parameters such as the car's company name, model name, year of purchase, and other relevant features.

## Features
- Predicts the price of a used car based on input parameters.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to train and predict.
- Provides insights into the factors influencing car prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Data Handling Libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy)
- Version Control (Git, GitHub)

## Usage
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - Gather data including car company, model name, year of purchase, and relevant parameters.
   - Clean and preprocess the data for machine learning.

2. **Training the Model**:
   - Train a machine learning model using historical data.
   - Implement algorithms suited for regression tasks.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Input parameters (car company, model name, year of purchase, etc.).
   - Obtain predicted price of the used car.
